# Self-Supervised-Label-Generator
This is a Python demo of the Self-Supervised Label Generator (SSLG), presented in "Self-Supervised Drivable Area and Road Anomaly Segmentation using RGB-D Data for Robotic Wheelchairs. Our SSLG can be used effectively for self-supervised drivable area and road anomaly segmentation based on RGB-D data".
